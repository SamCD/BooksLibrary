# BooksLibrary
A tool for keeping track of your Google Books

With the Books Library, you can keep track of all the books you own just by entering the 13-digit ISBN number. In addition to displaying the title, the main page will also show the author, page count and average user review of the book, as well as a thumbnail image of the book cover. Books can easily be deleted, if needed.

The package can be downloaded by cloning the URL

Please note, this project requires that the Flask module be installed. More information on Flask can be found here:

You will first want to register, by clicking the "new user" link at the top of the login page. Once registered, you can log in. The dashboard will initially empty, until you click the "Add New Book" link. There, you can enter the book's ISBN and it will automatically be added to your dashboard. If you need to delete a book for any reason, simply click the "Delete" button at that particular entry.
